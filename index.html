          <p>Flowers are the reproductive parts of flowering plants. A flower is a special part of the plant.
            Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant. Flowers have petals.
            Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce pollen and seeds.
            In all plants, a flower is usually its most colourful part. We say the plant 'flowers',
            'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out. T
            here are many different kinds of flowers in different areas in the world. Even in the coldest places,
            for example the Arctic, flowers can grow during a few months. Flowers may grow separately on the plant, or
            they may grow together in an inflorescence.</p>
